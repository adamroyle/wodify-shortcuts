Instructions
Hang cleans are above the knees and reps should be done as singles. On the split jerks, pause in the catch for 2 secs and focus on where your feet are. We like to see a good split that is even from front to back and the direction of your feet at 11/5 or 1/7 on a clock position. 

Same percentages as last week. Looking for solid technique improvements on the jerk for this piece.
