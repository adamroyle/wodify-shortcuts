Pre-Metcon

Today we run, it's been a good while since we have done some single modality running efforts. It would be easy to dismiss this workout as silly or easy or I could do this at home. Maybe you could do it at home but you probably won't and there is nothing like working out with mates. Try to keep your efforts within :10s for the 400's and :05s for the 200's.
