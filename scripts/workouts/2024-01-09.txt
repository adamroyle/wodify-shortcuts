1000m @ Zone 2 / 6 RPE

The goal here today is to tackle the 2000m Effort at 10k Pace or just over and descend pace slightly on each set in order to have the average pace per mile @ or slightly below 10k Pace. This should feel like a challenging effort, but absolutely doable within the pace and RPE zones.
