20:00 Minute FTP Test
This is the FTP test procedure according to Allen and Coggan
Step 1. Warm up: 7-10 minute easy riding
Step 2. 3 x 1 minute fast-pedaling interval up to max 105-120 rpm, and easy at 80 rpm for a minute between intervals
Set 3. 5 minutes at a lower pace to recover
Step 4. 5 minutes at your maximum pace. You should “explode” at the end of the 5-minute effort. It’s very important you do this before your 20 minute test.
Step 5. 5 minutes at a low pace to recover
Step 6. The real FTP: 20 minutes at your highest average power. Do not start too hard, but start strong and push yourself!
Step 7. Cool Down: 7-10 minute recovery at a moderate to easy pace
