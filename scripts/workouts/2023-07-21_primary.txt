STRENGTH/ACCESSORY

Standing Alternating DB Curl + Single DB Double Head Curl
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Focus: grasp a moderate weight dumbbell in each hand. Keep dumbbells slightly in front of the body at the bottom position to keep tension on the biceps throughout set. When curling, turn the arm thinking about getting the pinky finger close to the shoulder to maximize contraction with each rep. When finished with alternating reps, immediately grasp ONE dumbbell of a slightly heavier weight by each head and perform the remaining curls with both arms working at the same time.

4 sets: 8 reps (of each) - RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Standing KB Crush Grip French Press
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Focus: In a standing position, take a KB and grasp it between both hands around the bell portion (not the handles). Palms will be facing each other on either side of the bell. Lift the KB overhead, being mindful of the positioning of the handles so they don’t hit the head. Keeping the elbows tucked and pointed at the ceiling, lower the weight behind the head. Extend back overhead to complete. Be sure to keep core engaged and avoid overextension in the low back.

4 sets: 10 reps - RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets
