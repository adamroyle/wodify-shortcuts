250m @ Sustained Effort (7 RPE)
150m @ 3k Race Pace
Rest 2:00 minutes between set

This style of interval work is called flux training. We will be fluxing between strong sustained effort into a hard 150 to finish each lap. We will do this for 3 laps or 1200m, then rest 2:00 minutes before starting the next set. We will be doing 4x1200m here which is 4800m, which is just under 5k to give you an idea of the type of volume we are tackling for our interval session here. The idea here is that the race pace is dictated and we are looking for you to find what the fastest sustainable pace is for you to be able to recover enough to come back around for the 150 pick-up at the end of each lap. The ideal scenario would be to start more conservative on your 250m sustained effort runs before finishing with the prescribed 3k effort 150m. This will essentially create negative splits across all sets to allow for a really strong stimulus here helping to create a finishing kick.
Stimulus: V02 max / 3k TT Development
RPE: 8-9 RPE
