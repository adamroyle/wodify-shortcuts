Couple of options here today guys in terms of going solo or with a buddy. This workout being a chipper means you must complete all reps of the movement before moving on therefore there will be rest for even the best athletes so why not jump in with a partner and increase the intensity for this one.

We will start people on different stations today to allow everyone to hit the sections of work with no interference from others.
