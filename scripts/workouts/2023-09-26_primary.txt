Zone 2 Heart Rate
(A great session to hit for deload)
If you don't have correct data on Zone 2, use 180 - your age as your high end of heart rate for the day. This is not your average heart rate, but maximum. If you are 30 years old, this means that 150 will be the maximum heart rate you can allow yourself to go to. This is an absolute ego check on your aerobic base. Most that have not spent time building this system will have a hard time feeling like they are doing anything or getting anywhere, many will have to walk.
Score: The time it takes to complete the 5 miles, but you can only go at Zone 2 Heart Rate.
