Scale wisely today guys, there are 400 Double Unders in this workout so consider the volume for each round. The Push Press will also be tough as the fatigue from the doubles kicks in across the sets, your last weight should be around 80-85% of your 1rm Push Press at most and be challenging to complete however the aim should still be to do 5 reps unbroken.
