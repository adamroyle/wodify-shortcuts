STRENGTH

Back Squat

1 Back Squat, pick load

Every 1 min for 12 mins.

From 90-95% 1RM for all sets.

GYMNASTICS

Strict Pull Ups

EMOM
Start with whatever number you can hold for 10 mins.

If you cannot do strict do toe assisted strict and begin at 4’s, retest when you get to 8 for 6 mins.

Each week increase the reps, if you can’t hold it for ten mins, repeat weekly until you can.

Once you get to 50 total reps ie 5 reps for 10 mins then reduce the total mins and increase the reps per minute.

So you would go from 5 a min for 10mins, to 6 a min for 8 mins, then 7 for 7mins, 8 for 6mins, 9 for 5 mins and 10 for 4 mins

Once you are here, re-add the minutes but keep the reps at 10, until you can reach 10 a minute for 10 minutes.
