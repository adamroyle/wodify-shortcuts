Warm Up
2 Sets, For Quality:
1:00 Cardio Choice
10 Scapular Push-Ups
5 Walking Inchworm to Hollow
10 Barbell Goodmornings
5/5 Crossover Step-ups

Every 1 min for 40 mins, alternating between:
5 Deadlifts (heavy but unbroken)
15/12 Cal Ski
5 Strict Press (heavy but unbroken)
12 Single Dumbbell Box Step Overs, 22.5/15kg

Rest 1 minute

The focus today will be on the strength components. You have the option to treat the ski and box step ups as recovery, reduce the cals, reps and weight of the ski and step overs in order to go heavier on the deadlift and Press.

If you have missed a few workouts this week and want to get your conditioning on then focus more on that.
