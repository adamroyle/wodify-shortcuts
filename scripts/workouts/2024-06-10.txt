WORK YOUR WEAKNESS

Weightlifting
For load:
Pick one Movement: Snatch, clean, or jerk:
3 reps x 3 sets at 70-80%
2 reps x 3 sets at 80-90%
1 rep x 3 sets at 90%+

- Use a recent one-rep-max to find your percentages.
- Take the barbell out of a rack for the jerk.
- Rest as needed between sets.

Back Rack Lunge

- STRENGTH II -
For load:
Back rack lunge
4-4-4-4-4+
- Max reps on the last set.

- Find a heavy set of 4 alternating back rack lunges for the day.
- Use the same load for sets 4 and 5, but go for more than 4 reps in that final set without pushing to failure.
- Use a rack to get the barbell to your back rack.

Pistol Development
EMOM 12:
Minute 1 | :45 alternating single-leg squats
Minute 2 | 1:00 SkiErg

- Score = total single-leg squats.
- Consistent pacing and reps.
- Pick a maintainable ski pace that is just faster than a recovery pace. Avoid skiing so fast that you cause significant fatigue for the single-leg squats. We would rather see you score 10 reps across all rounds compared to scoring 20 reps in round one and then dropping off.

Scaling
**Single-leg squats** | Box- or ring-assisted
**SkiErg** | Row, single-unders
