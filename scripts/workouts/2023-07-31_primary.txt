STRENGTH/ACCESSORY

Alternating DB Bench Press
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

*Build to a moderate weight and stay the same or build across all sets.

Focus: Start with both DBs extended overhead. Bench with one arm, leaving the other arm extended overhead and then repeat with other side. Loading should be moderate and allow for control throughout entire rep. Select a weight that you can control when sitting back to start and sitting up to finishing set. Do not drop the dumbbells. To avoid injury, bring the knees up to meet the dumbbells and sit up with them. If you have to drop them to deload, you’ve gone too heavy.

4 sets: 10 reps (each side) – RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Standing KB Crush Grip French Press
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Focus: In a standing position, take a KB and grasp it between both hands around the bell portion (not the handles). Palms will be facing each other on either side of the bell. Lift the KB overhead, being mindful of the positioning of the handles so they don’t hit the head. Keeping the elbows tucked and pointed at the ceiling, lower the weight behind the head. Extend back overhead to complete. Be sure to keep core engaged and avoid overextension in the low back.

4 sets: 10 reps – RPE 7

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets
