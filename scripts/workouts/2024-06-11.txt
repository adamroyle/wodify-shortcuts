100-meter left-arm dumbbell overhead carry (35/50 lb)
100-meter right-arm dumbbell overhead carry
200-meter sandbag bear-hug carry
- Rest as needed between movements.

- Sandbag carry in 2-3 sets.
- Overhead carries in 1-2 sets.
- Use a moderate load that allows you to walk casually but feels challenging toward the end.
- Break the sandbag carries at the 100-meter mark and rest as needed. Then, push to finish the rest of the 200 meters in one set, breaking only if really needed.
- Push the overhead carries until failure, even if it means putting the dumbbells down 20 feet before the end of the 100 meters.
- Take longer rests during this piece and don't try to push the pace. Longer rest breaks with quick unbroken sets is preferable to taking a lot of breaks.

### Modifications:
**Sandbag carry** | Load, dual kettlebell front-rack carry, farmers carry
**Dumbbell overhead carry** | Load, use one arm if working around injury, kettlebell front-rack carry, suitcase carry
