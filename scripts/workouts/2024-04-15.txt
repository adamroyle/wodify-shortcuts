RPE: 7-9/10

Primary Objective: Negative Splits Across Sets
Secondary Objective: Stay Within RPE Guidelines

Start @ 5k Pace for both the Row and the Ski. The goal will be to increase pace over the course of each interval until we are finishing at around 2k Race Pace.

This should start out at a more moderate intensity 7/10 RPE and build to a challenging intensity of 9/10 RPE.

Stimulus: Lactate Threshold / Aerobic Capacity
