It's been over 9 years since we lost Justin. He was just 24 years old and his birthday was 12-3-91. We replaced the 12 with the 7 as that was his favourite number.
 
His unclaimed shoes still hang from his favourite pull up bar and his honour board is behind reception should you wish to take a read.
 
We'll never forget you bro...
 
I want the focus for today to be on a heavy technically sound snatch for 3 reps each round.
