You'll notice a different title today (competitor version), how is this different to RX+? Well the RX+ option is normally just an upgrade in weight and or skill allowing those more experienced athletes to challenge themselves while still maintaining the stimulus of the workout.

You will notice in the competitors version today the rep scheme and one movement changes, this is designed to place the athlete in a different fatigue state with larger more challenging sets and weight. The GPP RX version will allow you to build the reps with each round becoming more challenging however you have the opportunity to build volume by starting at lower rep ranges that won't prevent you from moving forward in the workout.

The competitor version today should be for those who have 15+ Unbroken HSPU otherwise the GPP option will actually allow for a higher volume and therefore more adaptation.

Part B - 5 Minutes Post A
Choose one of the following, for quality:
Run 1 Mile
Run 1km
Run 800m
Run 600m
Run 400m

The aim of this piece is to run at a pace that challenges your form but you can keep technique. You will be in a fatigued state post workout so imagine comparatively to a lift for example this should be done at 80% effort.

Pick a distance you can run the entire time.
