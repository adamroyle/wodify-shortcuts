MIDLINE

*this is 240 GHDSU, if you have not done 150 in a workout recently then do 6 rounds of 10-20 or 30 but remember this movement is notorious for causing rhabdo and severe DOMs. Do not hit the rx reps if you are not conditioned to that volume, if you are unsure then you are not conditioned to that volume.
