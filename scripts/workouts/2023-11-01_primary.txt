For time, partitioned any way:
240 Double Unders
120 Wall Balls, 20/14 lbs, 10 ft
60 Pull-ups
30 Deadlifts, 125/90kg

RX+: 143/100 kg
RXM: 100/70kg
Time Cap: 25 minutes

Today you have some autonomy with the breakdown of the workout. There are many strategies but if you look at the limiting movement and divide that byt the reps you know you can hold in one set, ie Pull Ups of which you can do 10.
 
Break the pull ups into 6 sets along with the other movements then x that by the rounds needed. In this case you would do:
 
6 rounds of:
40 double unders
20 Wall Balls
10 Pull Ups
5 Deadlifts
 
You could also eliminate a movement or two by going unbroken and removing them for your workout, eg if you can do 60 pull ups you could punch them out and break the other movements as required, I would see this as an advanced strategy to remove transitions and therefore time.
