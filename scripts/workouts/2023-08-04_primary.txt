STRENGTH/ACCESSORY

Bottom-Up Single Arm Standing KB Press
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

*Build to a moderate weight; stay the same or build across

Focus: While standing, hold a kettlebell by the handle with the bottom side facing the ceiling. This movement requires a very large amount of stabilization with the hand/forearm/shoulder. Be aware of kettlebell’s tendency to flip and potentially turn towards the face/head. DO NOT USE A WEIGHT THAT YOU CAN’T SHOW CONTROL WITH. Core should be engaged through out and athlete should avoid leaning towards or away from weighted side.

4 sets: 10 reps (each side)- RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Leaning Lateral Raise
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

*Build to a light weight, stay the same or build across sets

Focus: Athlete will stand next to a rig upright with feet in line with each other, heel to toe. The athlete will hold on to the rig and lean away, placing the body in a 45-60 degree angle from the floor. The free arm will hold a light dumbbell and lift the dumbbell laterally to shoulder height and then return down, stopping just before tension is released. This movement is not meant to be performed with heavy weight or momentum so be sure to keep movements controlled and steady.
