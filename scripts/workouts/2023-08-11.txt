STRENGTH/ACCESSORY

Double DB Bench Press 1 and ½ Reps
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

*Build to a moderate weight and stay the same or build across all sets.

Focus: Select a weight that you can control when sitting back to start and sitting up to finishing set. Lay back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Extend arms to the ceiling. Lower dumbbells down to the outside of the chest. Press halfway back up and then lower back to the outside of the chest. Press dumbbells back to full arm extension to complete rep. Do not drop the dumbbells. To avoid injury, bring the knees up to meet the dumbbells and sit up with them. If you have to drop them to deload, you’ve gone too heavy.

4 sets: 8 reps – RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Standing Tricep Extension w/ band
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

*Build to a moderate weight, stay the same or build across sets

Focus: Attach band to pull-up bar overhead. ALWAYS INSPECT BANDS FOR SIGNS OF POTENTIAL BREAKAGE BEFORE USING. Resistance should allow for control throughout the extension. Avoid going to complete lockout at the bottom: focusing on stopping just before full extension. Focus on engagement of triceps with each rep and stop before failure is reached. Torso should be slightly bent forward arms/elbows slightly in front of body

4 sets: 10 reps – RPE 7

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets
