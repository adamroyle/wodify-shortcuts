- As you warm-up, find a pace you can maintain for each distance. For example, don't perform the first 200-meter effort in 40 seconds and your last one in 1 minute. You're better off trying to hold 50 seconds for all 5 sets.
- You can get faster with each set, but not dramatically slower.
- Use your rest time to catch your breath and try to bring your heart rate down as much as possible. Focus on your breathing during this time.
- Modification: Row (same distance).
