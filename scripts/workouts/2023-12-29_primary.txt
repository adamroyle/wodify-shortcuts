Snatch

3-3-3-2-2-2-1-1-1-1

Our primary objective today is to build to a heavy single.

Optional Between Snatch Sets
10 x 40m Sled Push Heavy

The Snatch is the most technically demanding of all barbell movements. If you are proficient in the snatch then todays volume and weight will be demanding however if you are learning technique, while it will be neurologically tough the physical demands will be low therefore between rounds complete a heavy sled push.

At Home
10 x Hill sprints

Find a steep hill, run up it and recovery walk down.
