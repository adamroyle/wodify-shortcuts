RX+: Drag Rope

Today we will be tackling a version of "Lawry" a memorial workout dedicated to Chris Lawry who sadly took his own life at the beginning of 2023.
 
Chris was a massive part of the CrossAxed Community and while it is incredibly difficult to understand why Chris decided to leave this life, what we do know is he was severly affected by mental health issues and depression. Chris was being supported by those in the community closest to him.
 
Today is about having conversations, being vulnerable enough to let your mates know if you are having a tough time of it so they can be there to help. Its about supporting each other within the confines of something that has brought us altogether, health and community.
 
20 Minute AMRAP
Teams of 4 - 2 Athletes working at a time
12 Synchro BMU/Pull Ups
68 Double Unders/Drag Rope Singles
53 Synchro Burpees
200m Tethered Run
 
The way this will flow is 2 Athletes from the team will be working together at the same time. The team can split reps as desired for example 6 Synchro BMU per partnership within the team or sets of 2 until 12 is reached. Similar for the doubles, 1 pair will complete x amount of reps before the second pair takes over and finally the burpees will be whole team synchro.
 
*Don't stress if we have a team of experienced athletes mixed with newr or less fit athletes we have a plan so all will get the most from the workout.
