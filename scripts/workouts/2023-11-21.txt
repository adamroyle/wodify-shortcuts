Today's workout consists of four sets of 1000-meter intervals. In these sets, your main objective is to gradually increase your speed, ultimately finishing with a 100-meter all-out effort, similar to the pace you'd maintain during a maximum effort 400-meter run. Pay close attention to your breathing and running mechanics, especially during the early stages of each interval, as you prepare to accelerate towards the end. The rest periods between intervals are intentionally shorter than the distance you're covering because the initial 400 meters of each interval serve as an 'active' recovery period.
