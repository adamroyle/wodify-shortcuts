**Split reps as required, your score is your cals once back on the machine

You will need to work together to get back to the machine on this one, the first effort should be kept to around 8 minutes or less, at the top end each of the movements after that will take about 1 minute to complete leaving 2 minutes spare… Scale wisely and make it back to the machine.
