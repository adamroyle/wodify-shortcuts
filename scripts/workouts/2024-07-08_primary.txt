4 reps x 3 sets at 60-70%

- Welcome to week 1 of our Strength I cycle. For the next eight weeks, choose between snatch, clean, or jerk (push or split) and stick with the same lift for the entire eight weeks. You can change the lift in the next eight-week cycle.

- Take the barbell out of a rack for the jerk.
- Rest as needed between sets.

STRENGTH II
For load:
Deadlift 5-5-5-5-5+
- Max reps on the last set.

- Welcome to week one of our Strength II cycle where we will deadlift for the next four weeks. - Find a heavy set of 5 deadlifts. This may not be a 5-rep-max but find your heavy 5-rep lift for the day. - Use the same load for sets 4 and 5, but go for more than 5 reps in that final set without pushing to failure.

- STRENGTH III -
4 sets for load:
1:00 kettlebell front-rack hold
15 sumo stance good mornings

- Use the heaviest pair of kettlebells possible that allows for a challenging but manageable unbroken 1-minute hold.

- SKILL I -
10 sets:
50-ft handstand walk
- Rest 1:00 between sets

- Advanced athletes should try to complete each set unbroken. If you fail an attempt, go back to the start. If 50 feet is too far, reduce the distance to accommodate your ability.
