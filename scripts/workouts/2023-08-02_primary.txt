STRENGTH/ACCESSORY

Lying DB Hamstring Curl
*Rest 1:30-2:00 b/t sets

Focus: Lying face down on a bench, hold a dumbbell between both feet. Athletes may find that it’s easiest to have someone place the dumbbell between their feet rather than trying to load themselves. Extend the legs and curl the weight back to the starting position.

4 sets: 10 reps – RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Bent Over Barbell Row – Underhand Grip
*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets

Focus: With a double underhand grip, deadlift bar to waist and then lower to a hang position (right above the knees) to start each set. Aim to pull with the elbows (rather than the hands) and bringing the bar to the hips (do not pull high towards the upper abdomen). Focus on getting a strong back contraction with each rep. Minimize the amount of kipping used between reps and feel the stretch in the lats/upper back when lowering the bar back to the hang position with each rep.

4 sets: 10 Reps - RPE 8

*Rest 1:00-1:30 b/t sets
