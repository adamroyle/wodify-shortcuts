Today's focus is on refining our snatch technique with a progressive approach. We'll start at 40% of your 1-rep max Squat Snatch and gradually increase the load with each set. Remember, the journey through these EMOMs is as important as where we end up. By the final 5-minute EMOM, you should be hitting upwards of 75% of your 1-rep max Squat Snatch.
