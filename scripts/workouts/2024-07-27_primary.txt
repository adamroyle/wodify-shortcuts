*all movements completed with ruck on

For the ruck run today, bring an old backpack with some towels and we can add a plate or DB to the pack.

We can also scale the weight back to no weight.

No backpack no worries you can take one of the smaller sandbags with you.

There are plenty of options today, don't let the look of the workout stop you from attending.
