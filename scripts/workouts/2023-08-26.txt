Deadlift

Establish a 5 rep max in 20 mins.

A commendable objective for today is to exceed 85% of your maximum weight for a single repetition (1 rep max). Begin your session with 6-8 reps using an empty barbell to warm up effectively. Gradually increase the weight until you reach around 50-60% of your one rep max. Once you reach this range, focus on sets of 3-4 reps, adjusting the weight as needed to steadily progress towards achieving at least 85% of your one rep max.
Once attaining this target, congratulations! Add an extra 5-10 lbs to the barbell and challenge yourself with 1-2 additional attempts to set a new personal best for a 5 rep maximum (5RM) Deadlift.
