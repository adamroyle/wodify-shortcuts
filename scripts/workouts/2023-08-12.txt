WORKOUT

Mead
AMRAP (with a Partner) in 20 minutes
2 x 15 ft Rope Climb (RX+: Legless up and down)
100-meter Fireman Carry
 
Unless you are "close" with your partner, you probably won't want to do the Fireman carry (which is totally fine), instead, we will do a Farmer's Carry 32/24kg kbs 200m, each time you break on the carry including swapping complete 10 Synchro Russian KB Swings.

Complete as one rope climb each followed by the Fireman or Farmers Carry.

If doing the Carry start from the final standing position as seen in the video.

This British Hero WOD is dedicated to Nigel Mead (19) Royal Marines Commando, 42 Commando RM (Lima company), who was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan on 15/10/11. This workout is also dedicated to Kevin Fortuna, Ollie Augustin, and Sam Alexander who died in the same month.

We first found this workout on British Hero WODs, @britishherowods, on May 16, 2017.
