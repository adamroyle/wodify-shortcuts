For time:
Run 1000m
30 Bench Press @ Bodyweight
Run 1000m
20 Bench Press @ Bodyweight
Run 1000m
10 Bench Press @ bodyweight

Scaling:
Reduce the distance to 800 or 600m each round. Bench press weight should be something you can do for repeatable sets of 5 reps at a minimum.

A bodyweight push up would also be a great scaling option today.
