Squat and Sled
5 Rounds:

5 Back Squats (Pick Load)
25m Heavy Sled Push Sprint (Pick Load)
5 Back Squats (Pick Load)

Rest 3:00 Between Sets

First Set of Squats: Between 70-80%
Second Set: Between 60-70%

For todays weight choices, think of the first set as a 7/10 effort between 70-80%. After the Sled Push drop that weight back down to something that will be still tough as your legs are now more fatigued, but not too heavy that your sacrificing position and posture through the squat.
