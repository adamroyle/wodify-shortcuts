Rest 3:00 Between Sets

First Set of Squats: Between 70-80%
Second Set: Between 60-70%

For todays weight choices, think of the first set as a 7/10 effort between 70-80%. After the Sled Push drop that weight back down to something that will be still tough as your legs are now more fatigued, but not too heavy that your sacrificing position and posture through the squat.

Main Set
Goal: Increase pace from set 1-3, with the goal of increasing length per stroke and really building in a solid breathing pattern. We want to focus on trying to breath every 3 strokes, which means you will alternate which side to breath on each time. This will feel slower at first, but in time develop a better rhythm and cadence to your swimming.
Finisher
6 x 50 m Kick With Fins
