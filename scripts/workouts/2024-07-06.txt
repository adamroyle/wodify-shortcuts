Weighted Pull-ups

- STRENGTH II -
7 sets:
3 weighted pull-ups
- Rest 1:00-2:00 between sets.

- Increase loading across as many sets as possible; however, it is ok to perform the same weight for multiple sets.
- Use a dumbbell, a medicine ball, a vest, or a weight belt to add weight to the pull-ups.
- If you are not able to perform a strict pull-up, find the smallest assistance band possible that allows to you perform three smooth and controlled reps.
