Both the sandbag cleans and ring muscle ups are total reps between you and your partner. These reps DO NOT need to be evenly split between the partners, but each partner must complete at least 5 reps of both movements each round. Once the ring muscle ups are complete, you will run 400m together and then begin your next round.
