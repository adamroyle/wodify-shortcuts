On setup you will be prompted to enter your Wodify login details.

When you first run each shortcut, you will need to allow connections to `adam.royle.dev`.

They will now appear in your list of shortcuts and can then be added to your homescreen if you like.

## Adding the widgets to your homescreen

1. Press and hold the homescreen to enter `Edit` mode.
2. Then choose `Edit` > `Add Widget`.
3. Search Widgets for the `Shortcuts` app, and select it.
4. Tap `+ Add Widget` to add it to your screen. You can change the selected shortcut later.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add more widgets, then tap `Done`.
6. Press and hold on the widget that was just added, and select `Edit Widget`.
7. Tap the selected shortcut name and replace it with the correct shortcut.

## Voice prompt using Siri

Siri recognises shortcuts by their name, so you can trigger these shortcuts using the following phrases:

- "Hey Siri, Sign me in to CrossFit"
- "Hey Siri, What's today's workout?"
- "Hey Siri, What's tomorrow's workout?"
- "Hey Siri, All upcoming workouts"

## Automatic sign-in prompt

You can add an automation that runs when you arrive at the gym. [Here are some basic instructions](location-trigger.md).
